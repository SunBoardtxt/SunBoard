# Important Announcement
I'm searching for someone to help me at this project making something like a theme selector or so, also I want to make it that you can upload the images instead of just linking to them, if anyone could help me with that, I would be very grateful! But nothing more at the moment... <br>

# Installation

## For the first time
1. Download the stuff & unzip it.
2. Setup `config.php` in the main directory, you need to change these: `$mypagetitle`, `$subtitle`, `$antispam_word` and `$mysecretword` (and that for all `config.php` files you got, also in sub-folders).
3. Images (`$enable_guest_images`) are set to true by default, you can disable them by setting it to `false`
4. (Optional) If you have images enabled, you can change the size of them by changing the `$guest_image_size` to something else. (MAKE SURE YOU ALWAYS GIVE THE SIZE IN PIXEL, OR ELSE IT WON'T WORK!)
5. Edit files in the `/stuff/` directory: `header.php` and `index_header.php`
6. `header.php`: Link there to all your existing boards in `$pageheader`
7. `index_header.php`: For `$index_header` copy the stuff from `header.php` there and fix the links, for `$index_boards` you can do it how you like (still you should link to them)
9. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE CHMOD 777 ON THE FOLDER!
10. Setup boards (explanation below) <br>

## Upgrading from older Versions
1. Delete those files: `index.php`, `config.php` and `gb-exec.php`
2. DON'T DELETE THE `gbcontentfile.php`, THIS IS WHERE YOUR POSTS ARE STORED!
3. Upload the new files (make sure you don't replace `gbcontentfile.php` in any way) <br>
