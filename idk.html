I close my eyes, for once I don't have to try
I'm well-wishing for a life, I picture you happy, oh
In the weeds, we walked, your hand running through the moss
I was so lost in thought, but you were there living
You've taken me with you
Can I slow the days? I wish that I'll find the faith
I'm dying to save your place and you'll never suffer
We'll stay together
Oh, it's not alright, that one day we're all out of time
I'll write you another life, I'm sorry for crying
It's just that I love you
One day, can't be far enough
I had lost my sight
So you sang to me, the beauty you'd been seeing
If I can't stop time
I'll build a world where God cannot take us
There's no need to think of time
But then, you said, "Don't think of the time that's left"
You're spending it in your head, I just want you laughing
I'm sorry for crying, I just want you happy
So at last, could I?
I'll be happy just to have known you
And we wished each other well
